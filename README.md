## googleadvancedsearch
My second code sample is a program that automates the google advanced search progress given a query. 
I attatched the link to the video of it running here: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121731420/219998062-920c53e8-1c27-404c-861c-f0f2fc725282.mp4. 
The test case for this simulation was "windows, texas," so it will ideally find the company names, phone numbers and websites of
window manufacturers and vendors in the state of Texas.
